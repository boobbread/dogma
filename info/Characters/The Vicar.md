  - Stern

### Phase 1 — Initial State
- Belief: That the plague is a test or punishment from God.
- Coping Strategy: Remembering and sharing the sins of the people with the priest.
- How it works (for now): Confirms his belief that these people are impure and receiving the wrath of God.

### Phase 2 — Pressure
- What challenges their belief: They begin to notice innocent people falling ill, including a child he was close to.
- Consequences of their flaw: The deny the increasingly obvious truth of the plague. (Small tells that suggest he knows more than he lets on; coughing during sermons, refusing physical contact, emphasising endurance and faith)
- Player involvement: The player character (priest) confirms the vicars suspicions and notices his small tells.

### Phase 3 — Resolution
- Possible Outcomes:
  - Growth: The Vicar joins the Priest in his heretical practises, and is himself cured.
  - Failure: The Vicar is killed by the Priest to protect himself.
  - Corruption / Reinforcement: The Vicar attests against the priest in his trial of heresy, ratting him out to the inquisitors.
  - Neutral: The Vicar dies of the plague, viewing it and him failing the test of God.
